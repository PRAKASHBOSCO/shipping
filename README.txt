Please use the v5 version for any new installation, please note is upgrading from previous version to the version 5 is not supported until now, do it at your risk.
If you need the old version, please create a ticket here: https://support.spotlayer.com and one of our support team will respond with a link to it, we didn't include it here cause it make the size of the system more than 600 MB which will make it hard for a lot of user to download.
